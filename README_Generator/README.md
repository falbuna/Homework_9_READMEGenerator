## Description
The application will generate a README.md file from the prompts using Inquirer. As the user goes through each of the prompts, they will enter the information that they want added to the README.md file.

## Installation
The user will need to have node.js installed on their computer. They will also need to have the Inquirer package installed on their computer by typing npm install on the console while inside the folder.

## Usage
To use the application, the user will need to type in “node index.js” inside the folder that contains the application. Then the user will be given prompts that will be later used to have the inputs generated into the REAMD.md file.
