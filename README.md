# README Generator

Homework for Week 9

## Introduction

A good README will do the following: explain to the user what the application is for, how to use the application, how to install the application, how to report issues about the application, and get other developers to contribute to the development of the application. 

My motivation for taking on this project was to test my knowledge and skills on node.js and using a command-line application. I was also motivated in creating a dynamically generated README to allow the user to spend more time on the project, and less time creating the README.

## Description

This application uses node.js and the Inquirer package to dynamically generate a professional README.md file from the user's input generated from Inquirer.

## Installation

To install, the user will need to have Node.js installed. In the console (Bash, Powershell, or Terminal for Mac), the user will need to navigate to the folder that contains the index.js file. Once inside the folder, the user will need to ensure that the Inquirer npm package is installed. To do this, they will need to type in "npm install" inside the folder that contains the index.js file. Once installed, they can use this application.

## Usage

To start the application, the user will need to input "node index.js" into the console.

The user will be given prompts for the Project/Application. The information for the README.md file will be collected from the user input from the prompts for the Title, Description, Installation, Usage, License, Contributors, Tests, email and finally Github account.

After all of the prompts have been answered, the user will see "Completed."
